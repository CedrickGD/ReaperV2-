This is one of my first C# Windows Forms App's, in this case a little tool wich is designed to help you make changes to specific ark 1 settings like:
- Ini's
- Canva's
- Skin Textures
- Disc / Recon Feature
- Made ez gamma change

The programm is old and the default game files are on D drive so you might have to change them for you to be working :>

In future ill might update it so you can choose where you're game is installed and automaticly have it working.
